# LaikaWM
A lightweight compositor for Wayland that is inspired by many lightweight window managers written for X, particularly IceWM and Fluxbox, but with a focus on modern features, such as HiDPI support and window snapping.

## Features: 
  - A scalable interface: LaikaWM themes, rather than being composed of raster formats like XPM or PNG, use SVG instead
  - Multiple desktops
  - Window snapping: Windows can be snapped to the left or right half of the screen or any of 4 quarters
  - Themability
